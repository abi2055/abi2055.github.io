# abi2055.github.io

This is my personal portfolio website built with **React + Vite** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
The site is meant to showcase my projects and resume. I did it for fun and I like space (thats why its the theme). 

## Tech Stack
- **React + Vite** for fast development and bundling  
- **React Router** for page navigation  
- **Material UI (MUI)** for components and icons  
- **matter-js** for physics-based animations  
- Deployed with **GitHub Pages**
